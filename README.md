# Coding-Quiz-Challenge

This coding quiz emulates the Git Bash system.

It will ask the player 10 questions about coding.

After you answer a question, it will load the next question.

If you answer a question correctly or incorrectly, it will tell you the result.

If your answer a question correctly, your Score increases by 1.

If you answer a question incorrectly, you lose 5 Seconds from the Timer.

Your Score will equal the # of Questions answered correctly plus remaining time in Seconds.

Your Score will be displayed at the end.

I could not complete the rest of the objectives in time.
